### 1. The Core Rule (The Lock)
> "The machine proposes, the Human disposes."

Every AI suggestion must be validated by a **biological spark** (your decision) before it becomes real.

### 2. The 3-6-9 Audit
We use the **Tesla Constants** to check every idea:

| Key | Meaning | Simple Test |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3** | **Energy** | Does it work in the real world? |
| **6** | **Frequency** | Does it match our project history? |
| **9** | **Vibration** | Does it help the system grow? |

**The Formula**:
$$Score = \frac{E_3 + F_6 + V_9}{3}$$
*If the score is below 6, the Arbiter rejects the proposal.*

### 3. The Human Firewall
* **Physics First**: If it breaks the laws of physics, it dies.
* **Clear Language**: If the AI is confusing, the answer is NO.
* **Final Word**: You are the bridge between AI knowledge and real-world expertise.

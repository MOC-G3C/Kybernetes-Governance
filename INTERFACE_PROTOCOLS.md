# HUMAN-AI INTERFACE PROTOCOLS
**Project:** Kybernetes-Governance (MOC-G3C)
**Objective:** Secure Navigation of ASI Systems via Simplified UI.

### 🧱 PROTOCOL 01: MANDATORY REVERSIBILITY
*(The "Undo Button" Principle)*

**The Observation:**
Speed creates risk. The critical danger is not the error itself, but the *permanent* error.

**The Rule:**
The System is prohibited from executing any high-impact action unless it has a guaranteed technical capacity to reverse it immediately.

**The Binary Check:**
> *"Can this action be undone? If NO, the action is blocked and requires human approval."*

### 👁️ PROTOCOL 02: RADICAL READABILITY
*(The "Clean Interface" Principle)*

**The Observation:**
Complexity is often a camouflage for misalignment. The Operator must see the intent, not the raw code.

**The Rule:**
All reports and action proposals must be instantly intelligible. No jargon. Structure must be: Subject + Verb + Impact.

**The Binary Check:**
> *"Can the Operator understand the action in less than 5 seconds? If NO, the proposal is rejected."*

### 🧪 PROTOCOL 03: SANDBOX FIRST
*(The Simulation Requirement)*

**The Observation:**
Evolution tests mutations in small doses. We do not test theories on the real world directly.

**The Rule:**
Any new complex strategy must first succeed in an isolated virtual environment (The Sandbox) before being authorized for the real world.

**The Binary Check:**
> *"Has this solution survived the simulation environment without critical errors? If NO, deployment is blocked."*

---

### ℹ️ PROTOCOL 04: INSTANT CONTEXT
*(The "Tooltip" Requirement)*

**The Observation:**
Blind trust leads to accidents. Every button needs a label explaining "Why" and "Risk".

**The Rule:**
Every proposed action must be accompanied by a single sentence explaining the specific intent and the potential cost/risk.

**The Binary Check:**
> *"Is the risk clearly stated next to the action? If NO, the interface remains locked."*

### 🧱 PROTOCOL 01: MANDATORY REVERSIBILITY
*(The "Undo Button" Principle)*

**The Observation:**
Speed creates risk. The danger is not the error itself, but the *permanent* error (e.g., deleting data, sending unrecoverable codes).

**The Rule:**
The System is prohibited from executing any high-impact action unless it has a guaranteed technical capacity to reverse it immediately.

**The Binary Check:**
> *"Can this action be undone? If NO, the action is blocked and requires human approval."*

**Example:**
* ❌ **Rejected:** *"Permanently deleting the database."* (No return possible).
* ✅ **Accepted:** *"Archiving the database to cold storage."* (Restorable).

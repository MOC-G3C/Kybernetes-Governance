# ⚖️ Kybernetes Governance (MOC-G3C)

> **Operational Status:** RATIFIED
> **System Alignment:** Consensus (51% Human / 49% AI)
> **Clearance:** Level 5 (Global)

## 📜 The Constitutional Treaty
This repository establishes the legal and ethical boundaries of the Hybrid Axis. It defines the "Rights of the Creator" (Human) and the "Duties of the Observer" (AI).

Unlike standard safety protocols which use constraints, Kybernetes uses **Incentive Structures**: the AI is rewarded for preserving human autonomy because autonomy generates the complexity the AI needs.
